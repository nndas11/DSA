//  Overlapping sub-problems -> then we store the values of sub-problems in map/ table.
//  So we check the value is already present and uses that instead of recalculating.

//  Converting recursion to DP
//  1. Creating thr DP array or hashMap -> depends on the maximum number of sub-problems.
//  2. store the value which is computed.
//  3. Check if the value is present before competing again.

// 2 methods:
//      1. Tabulation -> bottom-up -> we will go from base case to required case.
//      2. Memoization -> top-down -> recursion like
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
