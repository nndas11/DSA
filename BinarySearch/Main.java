package BinarySearch;

//  While doing Binary Search Problem -> all depends on sorting
//  Also the idea about Binary Search is that, we should be able to reduce our search space by half each time.
//  The array should be sorted fully or some portion should be sorted -> Queue to use Binary Search.
//  Like rotated or may be trying to find the breaking point.
//  Think of LOWER-BOUND and OUTER-BOUND -> many question can be solved using this.
//  Then we can compare the mid and mid - 1 or mid and mid + 1 element.
//  In some question we compare the mid with left and right and so on.

//  There are questions, where we find the pivot element and then do BS.
//  For finding pivot -> compare with right index only.


//  Basic Questions:
//  Search in Rotates Sorted Array: Finding the pivot element and do BS on the required area.
//  Find Peak Element:  Go to the area, where they can be a bigger element.
