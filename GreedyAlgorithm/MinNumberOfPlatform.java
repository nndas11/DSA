package GreedyAlgorithm;

//  Given the arrival and departure time of each time.
//  We need to find the minimum number of platforms needed to accommodate it.
//  maximum number of guests present at the same time given arrival and departure times â€” which is a classic interval overlap problem.


//  So here, a new platform will be needed when we have an intersection.
//  Brute Force:
//  here we try to find the intersection against each train.
//  Nested loop and takes O(n2) time.


//  Optimal Way:
//  sort the times, and we use counter which gets increased on arrival and departed on departure.
//  the max value of the counter is our answer.
//  So we can sort them add in a separate data structure with identification for arrival and departure -> but this takes extra space.
//  Without extra space -> sort and use two pointers.
