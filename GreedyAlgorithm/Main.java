package GreedyAlgorithm;

//  A greedy algorithm is a strategy that makes the best possible choice at each step,
//  hoping that these local optimum choices lead to a global optimum solution.

//  Definition (In Simple Terms)
//  At every step, a greedy algorithm:
//  Picks the option that looks the best right now (locally optimal).
//  Doesn’t reconsider previous choices.
//  Aims to reach the optimal solution in the end — but doesn’t always guarantee it, unless the problem satisfies certain conditions.

//  Greedy Doesn't Always Work
//  Some problems look greedy, but need DP instead.

//  How to Know if Greedy Works?
//  Does making a greedy choice now guarantee the best final answer?
//  Try with a few counterexamples or prove with induction.
//  All questions may not give the answer with greedy approach.
