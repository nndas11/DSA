//  Set
//      - Set stores unique values.
//      - Also store in ascending order.

//  Use SET to erase already existing path.
//  Improves TC slightly -> removes is log(n).

//  HashSet in Java does not guarantee any order at all.
//  Java does not store elements in ascending order

//  TreeSet Overview
//  Stores unique elements in sorted (ascending) order by default.
//
//  Backed by a Red-Black Tree, like std::set in C++.
//
//  Offers logarithmic time for add(), remove(), and contains() operations.

//  So we were using PQ -> min-heap -> as we needed smallest element possible
//  But this also possible with Set data structure -> In set we store {dist, node}
