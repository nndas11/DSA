package Graphs.MinimumSpanningTress;

//  Given Undirected weighted graph.
//  N nodes
//  M edges

//  Minimum Spanning Tree(MST) is graph with N nodes and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other
//  We can have many spanning trees for a graph, it depends on the graph.
//  And the tree with minimum sum(sum of weights) is the Minimum Spanning Tree.

//*IMPORTANT* POINTS FOR MST:
//        1-> If each edge has a distinct weight then there will be only one & unique MST.
//        2-> A complete undirected graph can have n^(n-2) number of Spanning Trees. For example : Consider a triangle which have 3 vertices and 3 edges so n=3 || 3^(3-2) => 3. Hence , it would have 3 spanning trees.
//        3-> From a Complete graph by removing max(e-n+1) edges, we can construct a Spanning Tree.


//  Algorithms to find MST:
//      1. Prim's Algorithm
//      2. Kruskal's Algorithm -> Disjoin Set is a prerequisite.
