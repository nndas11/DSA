package Graphs;
//      DFS = traversing all the nodes
//
//      BFS = to find shortest distance  from source to destination in an unweighted graph
//
//      Dijkstra : from a single source, find shortest paths to all nodes.
//                 Works on both directed and undirected graph with non-negative edge weights, Greedy approach
//
//      Floyd-Warshall : shortest path from every node as a source.
//
//      Bellman-Ford : same as Dijkstra, but works for negative weights.
//                     Works on both directed and undirected graph with non-negative edge weights as well as directed graph with negative edge weights as long as no negative cycles are present, Dynamic Programming approach
//
//      Topological Sort : print the nodes with no incoming edges first.
//
//      MST : connect all the nodes with minimum costs (n nodes // n-1 edges).
//
//      Prim's Algo : build the MST by starting from any node and expanding the tree one edge at a time.
//
//      Kruskal Algo : build the MST by sorting all edges and adding them one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed.
